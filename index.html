            <h1>Therapeutic Counselling</h1>
            <p class="lead">Therapy can be hard to define because it can depend upon a person, our life experiences and what we choose to work on.</p>
            <p>
                You may feel you have a good understanding of what it is and what you would like to work on. If not, I appreciate it is helpful to have some understanding of what you would be doing.
                It is an opportunity for you to explore your thoughts, feelings and behaviours in a way you feel benefits your life right now.
                Some experiences can feel emotionally or mentally overwhelming and it can be helpful to have someone alongside you; to be with you in what you are feeling and provide some objectivity.
                Typically we would talk things over but I am also trained to work creatively or with the use of tools such as mindfulness if that appeals to you.
                We can work together to increase awareness of yourself.
                We can be with feelings that you may have felt scared to feel alone, and let them shift.
                We can work on behaviours that you may keep repeating and do not know why. We can reflect on relationships. We can work towards a goal you have or a problem you wish to tackle.
                This can help you feel stronger and more grounded as you make more aware choices of how you respond to problematic situations or accept/reduce the power of the past.

                I promise to be with you in however you are feeling with empathy, care and compassion.
                I promise to deeply reflect on our sessions and how best to achieve the most we can together.
            </p>
            <p>
                We can meet for a first session with no obligation to continue if it doesn't feel right for you. If it does, we may agree a block of time to work together or just take it a session at a time.
            </p>
